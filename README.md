# FieldSpecUtils

This pacakge provides users with pre-built functions for determining a variety of different indices used in remote sensing when maipulating hyperspectral data from 350 nm to 2500 nm in 1 nm intervals, as well as convolving said data to the spectral response functions of a variety of in-orbit sensors. This package should be used in conjunction with FSF's fork of the SpecDAL pacakge for best results. For more information, please contact the facility at fsf@ed.ac.uk
